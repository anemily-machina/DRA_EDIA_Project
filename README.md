## Roadmap & Milestones

- **Goals:** To gague knowledge of DRA services, what people want to learn, and create educational materials based on the survey.
- **Outcomes:** Release a survey to gague knowledge and interest in DRA services. Create approximately 6 hours of educational materials. Create two videos/hold two workshops on approximetly 2 hours of said eduational materials.
